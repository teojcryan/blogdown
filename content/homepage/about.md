## About Me

I graduated from the University of Warwick in 2022 with a MSc Mathematics of Systems, where my MSc thesis focused on nowcasting COVID-19 incidence in England. Prior to that,
I received a BSc (Hons) in Statistics (Specialisation in Data Science) and minors in Public Health and Geographical Information Systems from the National University of Singapore. My honours project focused on using serological data to predict population susceptibility to dengue over space and time in Singapore.

My research interests include infectious disease modelling, statistical learning, and biostatistics. In particular, I am keen on applying mathematical modelling to improve pandemic preparedness and outbreak response.
