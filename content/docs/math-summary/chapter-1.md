## Introduction to vector algebra

* Scalar quantities have magnitude but are not related to any direction in space
* Vector quantities are specificed by both a magnitude and a direction in space
    * position vector - with a fixed point of application
    * line vector - restricted to a fixed line of action
    * free vector - defined only by its magnitude and direction
