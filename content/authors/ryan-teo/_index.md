## About Me

I graduated from the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) in 2021 with a BSc (Hons) in Statistics (Specialisation in Data Science) and minors in Public Health and Geographical Information Systems. My honours project focused on using serological data to predict population susceptibility to dengue over space and time in Singapore.

During my time at NUS, I was also a resident of [Residential College 4](https://rc4.nus.edu.sg/), where I was trained in System Dynamics. I also served as the Research Director for the [NUS Public Health Society](https://nusphsoc.wixsite.com/nusphsoc). I also completed internships in the public sector, industry, and academic settings.

My research interests include infectious disease modelling, statistical learning, and biostatistics. In particular, I am keen on applying mathematical modelling to improve pandemic preparedness and outbreak response.
